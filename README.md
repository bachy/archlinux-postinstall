# Arch Linux KDE Plasma 5 Post-Install

## Arch install
please follow arch wiki [beginners' guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners%27_guide)

## Post install
once you can boot on your freshly installed arch and you are connected to internet, run the post-install.sh script

You can run it as root or as a regular user but this user have to be a sudoer

### Menu
the script will propose you functions to automatize some recurent process

- [x] create a regular user
- [x] install some basics packages
- [x] apply some config and cosmetics to prompt, vim, git, etc
- [x] create a gnupg key
- [x] secure the system (very very very basic)
- [x] install xorg server
- [x] install kde plasma 5 desktop manager
- [x] install AUR helper: yaourt
- [x] install CUPS (for printer)
- [ ] **(not ready)** install long term support kernel
- [x] install my default package setup (PIM, office, graphic design, devel)
- [x] install apache webserver, php, mysql

### bugs
This script is only my note taking along my discovery of Arch Linux install (after a year using Manjaro

It's not fully tested, and may fail at some points, feel free to report bugs, i would be glad to help, or fixe them, if i can/have the time/etc.

Feel free to fixe bugs, add features, with pull requests

This script reflect my vision of a an arch linux install, maybe not yours ...

This script only intend to install arch linux + plasma5 on my laptop only (gigabyte P34W v4) but it may also work for yours

### Learning
You may want to read and follow the post-install.sh script instead of runing it :)
